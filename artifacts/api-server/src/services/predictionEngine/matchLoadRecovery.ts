/**
 * EXPERIMENTAL -- not wired into the live ensemble, `EngineOutput`, or `EngineBreakdown`.
 *
 * Task #89's investigation found that the existing Fatigue module's 3/7/14-day recency-weighted
 * MATCH-COUNT windows are a mislabeled, inverted proxy for tournament-survivorship/winning
 * momentum, not physical tiredness (see `docs/audit-fatigue-window-logic-investigation.md`).
 * This module tests a structurally different idea: instead of counting how many matches a player
 * has played recently (which is confounded with "has been winning and advancing"), it looks only
 * at the player's SINGLE most recent prior match -- how many days of rest since it, and whether
 * it went the distance (a real physical-toll proxy independent of who won it). A short-rest
 * turnaround after a grueling match is a real acute-fatigue mechanism that doesn't require the
 * player to be on any particular winning or losing streak to occur.
 *
 * See `docs/audit-fatigue-redesign-investigation.md` for the full candidate comparison. THREE
 * candidates were tested: rest-days-only, went-distance-only, and a combination of both. Only
 * "went-distance-only" cleared both the decorrelation bar (<55% directional overlap with Recent
 * Form) and the accuracy bar (statistically significant above 50% given sample size). Rest-days
 * alone was REJECTED -- it turned out to be just another proxy for tournament-survivorship
 * (60.6% overlap with Recent Form, 49.7% accuracy, i.e. not even above coin-flip), the same
 * confound that sank the original Fatigue module. Combining it with went-distance diluted the
 * validated signal rather than improving it. Accordingly, `player1RestDays`/`player2RestDays`
 * below are still computed and returned for transparency, but do NOT feed the risk score --
 * only `player1RecentMatchWentDistance`/`player2RecentMatchWentDistance` does.
